This usage:
- You have one logger
- You have one filter, always turned on
- You want to format the message before it's written
- The logger has several log destinations
    - The output goes to console and debug output window
    - Formatting - prefix each message by its index, and append newline

Optimizations:
- use tss_ostringstream (each thread has its own ostringstream copy, to make writing faster:
  when logging of a message, we won't need to create the ostringstream first ; it's created only once per thread )
- use a cache string (from optimize namespace), in order to make formatting the message faster


In this example, all output will be written to the console and debug window.
It will be:

@code
[1] this is so cool 1
[2] this is so cool again 2
[3] this is too cool 3
@endcode
