/*
    Test : we use TSS (Thread Specific Storage). We check to see that there are no objects leaked.

    We create a number of threads.
    Each thread :
    - reads the current file - word by word
    - after each read, pauses a bit (like, 1 ms)
    - the words are concatenated, ignoring spaces
    - after the whole file is read, dumps to console : the thread index and the character at the thread's index from the concatenated string
    - we read as many words as there are threads (in order not to take too much time)

    The thread information is all kept using TSS



    Note: I've split the logic on multiple files, to test to see that we don't run into the Meyers Singleton bug.
