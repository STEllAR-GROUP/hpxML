[section:examples Examples]

Here are some more examples for our reader to get more familiar with HPX style
programming.

[/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////]
[section:hello_world Hello World v2]

You have already looked at a simple ["Hello World] example.  In this version
each locality will print out a statement that says which OS thread executed it
and which locality it came from.  The output will look something like this:

    hello world from OS-thread 2 on locality 0
    hello world from OS-thread 5 on locality 2
    hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0

[heading Setup]

The source file is already created for you and could be found in the svn 
repository: [^parallex/hpx/examples/quickstart/hello_world.cpp] or a 
here [fixme add a link here].  

To compile this file type:

    make examples.quickstart.hello_world

To run the program type:

    ./bin/hello_world

This should print:

    hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0

To include more threads use the command line option ['-t] and type the number of threads that you wish to use.  For example, typing:

    ./bin/hello_world -t2

will yield:

    hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0
    hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0

[fixme explain how to run hello world on multiple localites]

[heading Walk-through]

Now that you can complile and run the code lets look at how the code works
begining with main:

[import ../examples/quickstart/hello_world.cpp]
[hello_world_main]
[hpx_main]

In this excerpt of the code there are alot of new concepts such as 
["promise] which require explanation.  HPX is an ["action oriented] runtime
system, which means that the information shared between compute nodes is in
the form of ["work] or processes to be done.  This work is passed to other
nodes in containers such as a ["promise].  For these work-containers to
function properly, however, they must be wrapped in another device called
an ["action].  We do this by declaring this:

[action_wrapper]

Another way of thinking about this technique is as follows: functions are
wrapped in promises which are wrapped in actions which are distributed to
compute nodes.

The rest of this program uses other mostly self explainitory functions.  
For more information on those functions veiw our API [fixme link to API].

[section:accumulator Accumulator]

Accumulator is a simple example that exposes the notion of components in HPX.
Components allow us to run applicationin in distributed environment in HPX.
This example exposes four differenct functions: init, add, query and print.
What this example does is it takes an input from a client locality component,
puts value in a data type (unsigned long) at the remote locality component.
Print command at the client would print the contents of the remote locality
component at the remote locality. Query command at the client would print the
contents of the remote locality component at client locality.

[heading Building the example]

From your build directory, type the following:

    make examples.accumulator.accumulator

[heading Run the example]

From your bin directory inside install path, type the following:

[teletype][/ switch to plain text source mode]
On single machine, first console:

    ./accumulator_client -0 -l2

Same machine, second console, on identical path as above: [teletype]

    ./accumulator_client -1 -l2

[heading Results]

Console 1:

    accumulator client, you may enter some commands (try 'help' if in doubt...)
    add 5
    print
    query
    {0000000200ff0001, 000000000002ffff}> 5
    print
    add 5
    print
    query
    {0000000200ff0001, 000000000002ffff}> 10
    quit

Console 2:

    {0000000200000000, 00007fff21db4860}> 5
    {0000000200000000, 00007fff21db4860}> 5
    {0000000200000000, 00007fff21db4860}> 10
