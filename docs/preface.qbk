[heading History]

The development of High Performance ParalleX - HPX started back in 2007. At
that point Hartmut Kaiser became interested in the work done by the ParalleX
group at the __cct__ (a multi-disciplinary research institute at the __lsu__). 
The first implementations were crude at best and the team
had to dimiss those designs entirely. However, over time we learned quite a
bit about how to design a parallel runtime system which implements the ideas
of ParalleX, a new (and still experimental) execution model for future high
performance computer architectures.

The main emphasis of the development of HPX is to create a high quality, freely
available, open source implementation of the ideas of ParalleX for conventional
systems, such as classical Linux based Beowulf clusters or single highly
parallel SMP nodes. At the same time we wanted to have a very modular and well
designed runtime system architecture which would allow us over time to port our
implementation onto new computer system architectures. We want to use real
world applications to drive the development of the runtime system, coining out
required functionalities and converging onto an stable API which will provide
a smooth migration path for developers.

From the very beginning this endevour has been a group effort. In addition to a
handfull of interested researchers, there always have been students
participating in the discussions, the design, and the implementation of HPX.
In 2011 we decide to formalize our collective research efforts by creating the
__stellar__ group. Today, __stellar__ stands for 'Systems Technologies,
Emergent Parallelism, and Algorithms Research', which describes the three
main focal points we center our work around.


[heading How to use this manual]

Each major section is roughly divided into 3 parts:

# Tutorials: A step by step guide with heavily annotated code. These
  are meant to get the user acquainted with the library as quickly as
  possible. The objective is to build the user's confidence
  using the library through abundant examples and detailed
  instructions. Examples speak volumes and we have volumes of
  examples!

# Abstracts: A high level summary of key topics. The objective is to
  give the user a high level view of the library, the key concepts,
  background and theories.

# Reference: Detailed formal technical reference. We start with a quick
  reference -- an easy to use table that maps into the reference proper.
  The reference proper starts with C++ concepts followed by
  models of the concepts.

Some icons are used to mark certain topics indicative of their relevance.
These icons precede some text to indicate:

[table Icons

    [[Icon]             [Name]          [Meaning]]

    [[__note__]         [Note]          [Generally useful information (an aside that
                                        doesn't fit in the flow of the text)]]

    [[__tip__]          [Tip]           [Suggestion on how to do something
                                        (especially something that is not obvious)]]

    [[__important__]    [Important]     [Important note on something to take
                                        particular notice of]]

    [[__caution__]      [Caution]       [Take special care with this - it may
                                        not be what you expect and may cause bad
                                        results]]

    [[__danger__]       [Danger]        [This is likely to cause serious
                                        trouble if ignored]]
