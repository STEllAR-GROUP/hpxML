[heading General Changes]

With this release we put a lot of effort into changing the code base to be more
compatible to C++11 (all of the API uses variadic templates now). However, this
change required to modify the argument sequence for some of the exiting API
functions (`hpx::async_continue`, `hpx::apply_continue`, `hpx::when_each`,
`hpx::wait_each`).
