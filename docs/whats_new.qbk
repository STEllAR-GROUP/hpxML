[heading General Changes]

[heading Breaking Changes]

- In order to move the dataflow facility to `namespace hpx` we added a
  definition of `hpx::dataflow` which might create ambiguities in existing
  codes. The previous definition of this facility (`hpx::lcos::local::dataflow`)
  has been deprecated and is available only if the constant
  `HPX_WITH_LOCAL_DATAFLOW_COMPATIBILITY` is defined at configuration time.
  Please explicitly qualify all uses of the dataflow facility if you enable
  this compatibility setting and encounter ambiguities.


[heading Bug Fixes (Closed Tickets)]

Here is a list of the important tickets we closed for this release.

* [pr 1908] - Changing parallel::sort to return the last iterator as proposed by N4560
