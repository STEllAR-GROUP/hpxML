[section:hpx_0_8_0 HPX V0.8.0]

We have had roughly 1000 commits since the last release and we have closed
approximately 70 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

[heading General Changes]

* Improved PBS support, allowing for arbitrary naming schemes of node-hostnames.
* Finished verification of the reference counting framework.
* Implemented decrement merging logic to optimize the distributed reference
  counting system.
* Restructured the LCO framework. Renamed [^hpx::lcos::eager_future<>] and
  [^hpx::lcos::lazy_future<>] into [^hpx::lcos::packaged_task<>] and
  [^hpx::lcos::deferred_packaged_task<>]. Split [^hpx::lcos::promise<>] into
  packaged_tasks and [^hpx::lcos::futures<>]. Added 'local' futures
  (in namespace [^hpx::lcos::local]).
* Improved the general performance of local and remote action invocations.
  This (under certain circumstances) drastically reduces the number of copies
  created for each of the parameters and return values.
* Reworked the performance counter framework. Performance counters are now
  created only when needed, which reduces the overall resource requirements.
  The new framework allows for much more flexible creation and management
  of performance counters. The new sine example application demonstrates some
  of the capabilities of the new infrastructure.
* Added a buildbot-based continuous build system which gives instant, automated
  feedback on each commit to SVN.
* Added more automated tests to verify proper functioning of HPX.
* Started to create documentation for HPX and its API.
* Added documentation toolchain to the build system.
* Added dataflow LCO.
* Changed default HPX command line options to have [^hpx:] prefix. For
  instance, the former option [^--threads] is now [hpx_cmdline [^--hpx:threads]].
  This has been done to make ambiguities with possible application specific
  command line options as unlikely as possible. See the section __commandline__
  for a full list of available options.
* Added the possibility to define command line aliases. The former short
  (one-letter) command line options have been predefined as aliases for
  backwards compatibility. See the section __commandline__ for a detailed
  description of command line option aliasing.
* Network connections are now cached based on the connected host. The number of
  simultaneous connections to a particular host is now limited. Parcels are
  buffered and bundled if all connections are in use.
* Added more refined thread affinity control. This is based on the external
  library __hwloc__. 
* Improved support for Windows builds with CMake.
* Added support for components to register their own command line options.
* Added the possibility to register custom startup/shutdown functions for
  any component. These functions are guaranteed to be executed by an HPX
  thread.
* Added two new experimental thread schedulers: hierarchy_scheduler and
  periodic_priority_scheduler. These can be activated by using the command line
  options [hpx_cmdline [^--hpx:queueing=hierarchy]] or
  [hpx_cmdline [^--hpx:queueing=periodic]].

[heading Example Applications]

* [@http://www.graph500.org/ Graph500 performace benchmark] (thanks to Matthew
  Anderson for contributing
  this application).
* [@http://www.nersc.gov/research-and-development/benchmarking-and-workload-characterization/nersc-6-benchmarks/gtc/ GTC (Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code)]:
  a skeleton for particle in cell type codes.
* Random Memory Access: an example demonstrating random memory accesses in a
  large array
* [@http://stellarcollapse.org/equationofstate ShenEOS example], demonstrating
  partitioning of large read-only data structures and exposing an interpolation
  API.
* Sine performance counter demo.
* Accumulator examples demonstrating how to write and use HPX components.
* Quickstart examples (like hello_world, fibonacci, quicksort, factorial, etc.)
  demonstrating simple HPX concepts which introduce some of the concepts in
  HPX.
* Load balancing and work stealing demos.

[heading API Changes]

* Moved all local LCOs into a separate namespace `hpx::lcos::local` (for
  instance, `hpx::lcos::local_mutex` is now `hpx::lcos::local::mutex`).
* Replaced `hpx::actions::function` with `hpx::util::function`. Cleaned up
  related code.
* Removed `hpx::traits::handle_gid` and moved handlingn of global reference
  counts into the corresponding serialization code.
* Changed terminology: `prefix` is now called `locality_id`, renamed the
  corresponding API functions (such as `hpx::get_prefix`, which is nowc alled
  `hpx::get_locality_id`).
* Adding `hpx::find_remote_localities`, `hpx::get_num_localities`,
* Changed performance counter naming scheme to make it more bash friendly.
  The new performance counter naming scheme is now

[teletype]
``
    /object{parentname#parentindex/instance#index}/counter#parameters
``
[c++]

* Added `hpx::get_worker_thread_num` replacing `hpx::threadmanager_base::get_thread_num`.
* Renamed `hpx::get_num_os_threads` to `hpx::get_os_threads_count`.
* Added `hpx::threads::get_thread_count`.
* Restructured the Futures sub-system, renaming types in accordance with the
  terminology used by the C++11 ISO standard.
