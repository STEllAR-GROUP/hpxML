[section:windows_installation How to Install __hpx__ on Windows]

[heading Installation of Required Prerequisites]

* Download the Boost c++ libraries from __boost_downloads__
* Install the boost library as explained in the section __boost_installation__
* Download the latest version of __cmake__ binaries, which are located under
  the platform section of the downloads page at __cmake_download__.
* Download the latest version of __hpx__ from the __stellar__ website:
  __stellar_hpx_download__

[heading Installation of the __hpx__ Library]

* Create a build folder. __hpx__ requires an out-of-tree-build. This means that you
  will be unable to run CMake in the __hpx__ source folder.
* Open up the CMake GUI. In the input box labelled "Where is the source code:",
  enter the full path to the source folder. The source directory is one where the
  sources were checked out. CMakeLists.txt files in the source directory as well as the
  subdirectories describe the build to CMake. In addition to this, there are CMake
  scripts (usually ending in .cmake) stored in a special CMake directory. CMake does not
  alter any file in the source directory and   doesn't add new ones either. In the input
  box labelled "Where to build the binaries:", enter the full path to the build folder you
  created before. The build directory is one where all compiler outputs are stored, which
  includes object files and final executables.
* Add CMake variable definitions (if any) by clicking the "Add Entry" button.
  There are two required variables you need to define: `BOOST_ROOT` and
  `HWLOC_ROOT`. These (PATH) variables need to be set to point to the root
  folder of your __boost__ and __hwloc__ installations.
  It is recommended to set the variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` as
  well. This determines where the HPX libraries will be built and installed.
  If this (PATH) variable is set, it has to refer to the directory where the
  built __hpx__ files should be installed to.
* Press the "Configure" button. A window will pop up asking you which compilers
  to use. Select the Visual Studio 10 (64Bit) compiler (it usually is
  the default if available). The Visual Studio 2012 (64Bit) and Visual Studio
  2013 (64Bit) compilers are
  supported as well. Note that while it is possible to build HPX for x86,
  we don't recommend doing so as 32 bit runs are severely restricted by a 32 bit
  Windows system limitation affecting the number of HPX threads you can create.
* Press "Configure" again. Repeat this step until the "Generate" button becomes
  clickable (and until no variable definitions are marked red anymore).
* Press "Generate".
* Open up the build folder, and double-click hpx.sln.
* Build the INSTALL target.

For more detailed information about using __cmake__ please refer its documentation
and also the section __cmake_hpx__.
