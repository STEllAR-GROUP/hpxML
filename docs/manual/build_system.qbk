[section:build_system The HPX Build System]

The buildsystem for __hpx__ is based on __cmake__. CMake is a cross-platform
build-generator tool. CMake does not build the project, it generates the files
needed by your build tool (GNU make, Visual Studio, etc) for building __hpx__.

This section gives an introduction on how to use our build system to build HPX
and how to use HPX in your own projects.
