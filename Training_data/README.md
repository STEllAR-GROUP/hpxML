# Data Generations

This directory allows for data generation. To generate data, lambda functions are run with different chunk-size candidates and the execution times are measured and outputted.

here are the different function which are defines in headers files at algorithm/dynamic_and_execution/ here are the different functions

1. Swap()
1. Stream()
1. Cosine()
1. Matrix_Vector_Mult()
1. Diadic_Prod()
1. Triples
1. Matrix_Matrix_Mult()
1. Tensor_generator()

Look at the wiki section for more details.
