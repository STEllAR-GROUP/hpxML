# Locate the Vc template library. Vc can be found at https://github.com/VcDevel/Vc
#
# This file is meant to be copied into projects that want to use Vc. It will
# search for VcConfig.cmake, which ships with Vc and will provide up-to-date
# buildsystem changes. Thus there should not be any need to update FindVc.cmake
# again after you integrated it into your project.

# This module defines the following variables:
# Vc_FOUND
# Vc_INCLUDE_DIR
# Vc_LIBRARIES
# Vc_DEFINITIONS
# Vc_COMPILE_FLAGS
# Vc_ARCHITECTURE_FLAGS
# Vc_ALL_FLAGS (the union of the above three variables)
# Vc_VERSION_MAJOR
# Vc_VERSION_MINOR
# Vc_VERSION_PATCH
# Vc_VERSION
# Vc_VERSION_STRING
# Vc_INSTALL_DIR
# Vc_LIB_DIR
# Vc_CMAKE_MODULES_DIR

# The following two variables are set according to the compiler used. Feel free
