This code implements graph traversal using Breadth-first search.  It reads the graph in
from the file g1.txt as default and outputs the parent and level of each node.

Options:  --n gives the maximum number of nodes to search in the graph
          --root selects the node number specified as the root
          --graph reads in a different graph file

 Example:

   bfs_client --n 64 --graph g7.txt --root 7

  would look for the file g7.txt, read in the first 64 nodes, and traverse the graph with root at node
number 7.
